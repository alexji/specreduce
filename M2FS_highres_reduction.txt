Notes on the reduction of highres m2fs data. 

bc1 ccd has a bad pixel column after sep14 data, correct using badpix mask


-Changes to reduction procedure for low resolution data
All program changed have my initial infront, th_orginalname.pro

-Steps taken in reduction procedure:

1. run first point of th_m2fs_reduce.pro, first with run1=1, run2=0 

This combines images from the four amplifiers and do the bias subtraction
using the overscan region. 

bxxx.fits blue 4 amplifiers merged 

2 make master dark image using mdark.pro and run th_m2fs_reduce.pro with
run1=0 and run2=1 to subtract dark current

3. Combine twillight and quartz flats using th_m2fs_mflat.pro 

4. remove cosmic from science frames with th_m2fs_crbye 
   do not use more than three science frames for each run, to make cosmic ray removal most efficeint

5. trace orders on CCD with th_m2fs_trace.pro  

Check trace with atv, for half orders the trace can be bad


6. flat correct science frames with th_m2fs_flat.pro


7. combine science frames from the same night with th_m2fs_imcombine.pro


8. use iraf (apfind, aptrace, apall and identify) to extract middle 4
orders on one of the blue and red ThAr frames and find wavelenght
solution. Create list of pixel and lambda values for each of the four orders,


9. run th_m2fs_wave_mpfit.pro -this uses mpfit to fit an lengdre polynimial to
the pixel and wavelength values, based on a cross correlation with the order
examined in iraf. This program extract middle four order and crosscorrelate
these with the rest, to finde offset, this is then used to find wavelength 
solution using the output from identify.


change pixel-lambda list for the four order and the 'template' set of orders
to the right order nr. in the beginning of the program. 


10. remove sky with th_m2fs_skysub.pro

identify sky fibers in red and blue CCD, create skyfib list 


11. extract spectra with th_m2fs_extract.pro 
Set name of spectra in bottom of file.
Extracts each order into a single spectrum.
